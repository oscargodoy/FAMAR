## SITE: Sampling site (CN1: intertidal, 0.4 mLAT; CN2: near-subtidal, -0-08 mLAT  and CN3: far-subtidal, -0.5 mLAT)
## YEAR: Year
## SEASON: This needs to be sort as WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER and FALL
## BUSCAR: search code (to delete)
## DW_LL: Dry weight/Leaf length ratio [gDW cm-1]
## t.d: number of days from punching date (t0) until collection date (tf)
## R.date: Real date when the shoot was collected from the field (tf)
## S.date: Statistical date. Mean date from all sampling dates including biomass and punching field work per season
## replicate: Code of the punched shoot
## LER: Leaf elongation rate (cm plant-1 d-1)
## LGR: Leaf growth rate (mg DW plant-1 d-1)
## RGR: Relative leaf growth rate (cm cm-1 plant-1 d-1)
## LAR: Leaf appearance rate (Nº leaves plant-1 d-1)
## LLR: Leaf loss rate (cm plant-1 d-1)
## LLRw: Leaf loss rate per weigth(mg DW plant-1 d-1)
## PI: Plastochrone index (d)
## SDW: Shoot dry weigth (proxy for shoot size) [gDW shoot-1] #Check this units!
## source: source of SDW. If 'real' it is the real weight of the shoot at tf, but if this value is missing (DW.EST), it was estimated from the sum of all LL (cm) of the shoot at tf multiplied by DW_LL.


######### water nutrient concentration has been downloaded http://dma.agenciamedioambienteyagua.es/ using information available from stations: PUERTO DE CADIZ - BAHIA INTERNA DE CADIZ (3 and 4)

## NO3.uM.mean: Seasonal average of nitrate concentration in water [umol L-1]
## PO4.uM.mean: Seasonal average of fosfate concentration in water [umol L-1]
## NH4.uM.q2: Seasonal median value of ammonium concentration in water [umol L-1]
## NO2.uM.q2: Seasonal median value of nitrite concentration in water [umol L-1]
## NO3.uM.q2: Seasonal median value of nitrate concentration in water [umol L-1]
## PO4.uM.q2: Seasonal median value of fosfate concentration in water [umol L-1]

###### light and temperature information comes from EO data and light at different elevations has been modelled taking into account Kd due to water column (modelling(elevation + tidal sea level)
## Tair.degC.q2: Median Air temperature [ºC]. Median value from 45 days before S.date indicated
## T.d.min.q2: Min Air temperature [ºC]. Min. value during 45 days before S.date indicated
## T.d.max.q2: Max. Air temperature [ºC]. Max. value during 45 days before S.date indicated
## Ed.mol_m2d.q2: Daily light dose at surface [mol m-2 d-1]
## siteB: useless code
## EzSITE.mol_m2d.q2: Daily light dose corrected by depht and tidal height [mol m-2 d-1]
